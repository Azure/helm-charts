[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/helm-charts.svg?style=svg&circle-token=e8c9c6863d2aac35c678888ca7346618be17aeb8)](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/helm-charts)

# Overview

This repository contains [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts for use with the
[Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)
and the 
[Microsoft Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure].

| ðŸš¨  | The project is in **alpha** status. This means that no assurances are made about backwards compatibility or stability until [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure) has reached v1. |
|---|---|

Each chart has one or more dependencies on Azure services (e.g. Azure SQL, CosmosDB, ...)
which are fulfilled by [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure) and
the [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) working
in tandem.

The following charts are available:

- [Concourse CI](./concourse)
- [Wordpress](./wordpress)
- [phpBB](./phpbb)
- [Drupal](./drupal)
- [Ghost Blog](./ghost)

# Prerequisites

You'll need a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster, version 1.7 or later,
with [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog)
and [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure) 
installed on it.

Please see [the prerequisities guide](./docs/prerequisities/README.md) for 
details on how to install all of these prerequisities.

# Installing Charts

All of the charts herein are stored in a 
[Helm chart repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_repository.md). 

First, add the Azure charts repository to your local list:

```console
helm repo add azure https://kubernetescharts.blob.core.windows.net/azure
```

After you've added the Azure charts repository, you'll have access to the charts you see here.
For example, you can search for charts:

```console
$helm search wordpress
NAME            	VERSION	DESCRIPTION
azure/wordpress 	0.6.12 	Web publishing platform for building blogs and ...
local/wordpress 	0.6.12 	Web publishing platform for building blogs and ...
stable/wordpress	0.6.10 	Web publishing platform for building blogs and ...
```

Notice that `azure/wordpress` is listed above. This is the chart that you see in this
Github repository.

# Creating a New Chart

If you are looking to create a chart, please see the list of with the `Help Wanted`
label [here](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

If you decide to create a new chart, please follow the following guidelines:

- Look at the [upstream charts repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts) for prior art
- Wherever possible, ensure that your chart has the option to install the service to be 
provisioned locally, in the cluster
    - For example, if your chart provisions Azure MySQL, ensure that the chart can be 
    installed with the option to create a MySQL instance in the cluster. The default should
    be to provision on Azure
- Include a detailed README.md and NOTES.txt file for your chart
    - [Here](./wordpress/templates/NOTES.txt) is an
    example of a NOTES.txt file
